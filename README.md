*Code available for all projects upon request.*
## *Baba Is You* Lite
Implements the rules for a video game based on the existing game *Baba Is You*. 

*Baba Is You* is a puzzle game in which the player works to achieve
a win state by manipulating the environment in certain ways specified by the rules. However, the player is also allowed to manipulate the rules themselves.

The actual *Baba Is You* has many rules that are gradually revealed throughout the course of the game. This version only implements the basic push and pull rules, the ability to transform objects in the environment, and the ability to change the rules.

## Audio Manipulation
Given audio files represented as a list of audio samples sampled at a set rate, performs various manipulations on those files. These manipulations include:
- Reversing the sound
- Mixing two sounds together
- Adding echoes to a sound
- Adding a pan effect

## Image Manipulation
Given images represented as a list of pixels, performs various manipulations on those images. These manipulations include:
- Applying an inversion filter to the image
- Blurring the image
- Sharpening the image
- Applying a Sobel operator to the image (i.e. emphasizing the image's edges)
- Applying a ripple filter to the image

These manipulations can be used on both greyscale and color images.
